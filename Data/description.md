This folder contains the data obtain from the tagging process to the axial coding of the practices. For more information, please read the `description.md` on each folder.

- `Initial_info_of_papers`: Information related to the papers, a complete list of papers that were obtained from the queries on ACM Digital Library and IEEE Explore, the number of pages, and the pre-filtering done by three taggers to identify if one paper was useful or not for the study.
