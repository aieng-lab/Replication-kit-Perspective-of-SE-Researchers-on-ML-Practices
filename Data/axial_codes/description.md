For each studied variable in the study (e.g., Input):
- Unique codes and the axial category assign (e.g., `11_unique_inputs.xlsx`)
- Counts and percentages for each category (e.g., `11_unique_inputs.xlsx`)
- Plot(s) showing the results, i.e., previous bullet (e.g., `result_Input_axial_plot_1.pdf`) 

In addition a file with all the subjects and its corresponding axial categories is also provided, i.e., `result_Axial_categories.xlsx`
