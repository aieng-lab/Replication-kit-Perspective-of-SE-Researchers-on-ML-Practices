# Folder content
This folder contains all the jupyters used to extract and calculate the results in the study. In each Jupyter you will find the description of it.

- `Get_Number_codes_RAW`: Code used to get the statistics about the initial codes for all subjects (i.e., counts before the harmonization). At the end of the notebook, the code used to compute the average length of interviews and surveys is available.
- `Papers_filering_and_numbers`: Code that is used to get statistics about the papers (e.g., mean number of authors, unique authors, average length). In addition, it also contains information on how to compute the interrater agreement of the pre-filtering of the papers. 
- `Axial_unification_Plots_Counts`: Code to get statistics (counts) over the harmonized codes for every studied subject. In addition, this code is also used to assign the axial categories to each of the different harmonized codes assigned to the coded instances (i.e., papers, interviews, and surveys). Lastly, this code also generates the statistics (counts and percentages) about the axial coding and plots.
